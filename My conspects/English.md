Hi,

Sorry that I haven’t been in touch for a while but I’ve been busy. So I’ve been catching up on my emails. Luckly my classes at university don’t start till next week. How are you? What have you been doing? Anything exciting. Here everyone are fine – apart from me and my flu! My brother Max has just started his new job - I think I told you about it when I last wrote – anyway, he’s really enjoying it. How are your family? I hope they’re well.

I have a good news – I’m going to a give a presentation/talk in our town in may on common illnesses and injuries. Could you give me some advice on how to do it and what to focus on? It needs to be short but informative. Do you think I will do well? That would be great.

Well, that’s all for now. Please give my regards to your family. I hope to hear from you soon.

Take care,

Big Boss

#### the first version
Hi!

Thanks for your email, I am glad to hear from you again. Well, hope you lessons will be great and you will recover from your illness. As for me, I have already started my education year and it’s fantastic. My family is OK, doing well with their gardening chores.

As for your news, I think it will be a piece of cake for you. You are great at presentations. To my mind, it’s important to focus on the practical usage of information you are going to give to the audience. Tell about first aid and perhaps about the mistakes people make sometimes. Nowadays it very import thing. Also, do not try to give all information about the problem, as you told, it’s import to be short and informative.

I have to go now. Drop me a line when can!

Love,

Artem

Hi Big Boss,

It's great to hear from you! I completely understand how busy life can get, especially with university obligations looming. As for me, I've been keeping busy as well, though thankfully, nothing as troublesome as the flu—I'm sorry to hear you're under the weather. I hope you recover quickly!

It's wonderful to hear that Max is thriving in his new job! It's always uplifting to see our loved ones find their place and enjoy what they do.

Regarding your upcoming presentation on common illnesses and injuries, I think it’s an excellent topic and very relevant. To keep it short yet informative, consider structuring your talk around a few key points. You might want to open with an engaging statistic or anecdote to capture the audience's attention. Then, focus on the most prevalent illnesses and injuries, outlining their symptoms, prevention, and when to seek medical help. Ending with practical tips or resources for your audience could leave a lasting impression.

I have no doubt that you will do well! Your enthusiasm for your subject matter will undoubtedly resonate with your audience.

Please pass along my regards to your family as well, and I look forward to hearing more about your presentation preparations. Take care and get well soon!

Best wishes,  
(Your Name)

The person who admired most at me is my school IT teacher. Her name is Elena Viktorovna and she has been teaching my school class during

open-minded, intorvert, calm sincere, not easy-going, not arrogant and vain

intorvert, sometimes arrogant, don't like asking question, oppsite role model, not so hardworking, no public things=: asks all questions, never angy to others, hardworking, extravert, public things.

as rolemodel: assertive, stubborn, calm, optimistic, open-minded
not as role model: not so self-confident, role model is more smart

I would like to tell you about my classmate Larry and compare him with his role model. His is a very interesting person. The person he admires is his IT teacher, who teached him during his 10 school year.

So, it is important to know that he is pretty opposite to his role model. For example, his teacher is an extravert who is always ready to ask any questions. But Larry says that sometimes he can be arrogant if people ask him questions, which are obvious for him. Also, Larry doesn't like any public speaks, but his teacher does. He can be really eloquent during his spiches. Larry says that he is not so hardworking as his teacher, who is very well educated and devoted to his work

In conclution I want to say that Larry is a very intellegent and smart person. He is always very polite and, to my mind, rather hardworking, as he hasn't skipped any English lessons. He is not so self-confident, as it is difficult for him tell possitive sides of his personality. Also he is comfortable person, who, i m sure, will be very succesfull
