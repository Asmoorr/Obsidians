Hi,

Sorry that I haven’t been in touch for a while but I’ve been busy. So I’ve been catching up on my emails. Luckly my classes at university don’t start till next week. How are you? What have you been doing? Anything exciting. Here everyone are fine – apart from me and my flu! My brother Max has just started his new job - I think I told you about it when I last wrote – anyway, he’s really enjoying it. How are your family? I hope they’re well.

I have a good news – I’m going to a give a presentation/talk in our town in may on common illnesses and injuries. Could you give me some advice on how to do it and what to focus on? It needs to be short but informative. Do you think I will do well? That would be great.

Well, that’s all for now. Please give my regards to your family. I hope to hear from you soon.

Take care,

Big Boss

#### the first version
Hi!

Thanks for your email, I am glad to hear from you again. Well, hope you lessons will be great and you will recover from your illness. As for me, I have already started my education year and it’s fantastic. My family is OK, doing well with their gardening chores.

As for your news, I think it will be a piece of cake for you. You are great at presentations. To my mind, it’s important to focus on the practical usage of information you are going to give to the audience. Tell about first aid and perhaps about the mistakes people make sometimes. Nowadays it very import thing. Also, do not try to give all information about the problem, as you told, it’s import to be short and informative.

I have to go now. Drop me a line when can!

Love,

Artem

Hi Big Boss,

It's great to hear from you! I completely understand how busy life can get, especially with university obligations looming. As for me, I've been keeping busy as well, though thankfully, nothing as troublesome as the flu—I'm sorry to hear you're under the weather. I hope you recover quickly!

It's wonderful to hear that Max is thriving in his new job! It's always uplifting to see our loved ones find their place and enjoy what they do.

Regarding your upcoming presentation on common illnesses and injuries, I think it’s an excellent topic and very relevant. To keep it short yet informative, consider structuring your talk around a few key points. You might want to open with an engaging statistic or anecdote to capture the audience's attention. Then, focus on the most prevalent illnesses and injuries, outlining their symptoms, prevention, and when to seek medical help. Ending with practical tips or resources for your audience could leave a lasting impression.

I have no doubt that you will do well! Your enthusiasm for your subject matter will undoubtedly resonate with your audience.

Please pass along my regards to your family as well, and I look forward to hearing more about your presentation preparations. Take care and get well soon!

Best wishes,  
(Your Name)

The person who admired most at me is my school IT teacher. Her name is Elena Viktorovna and she has been teaching my school class during

open-minded, intorvert, calm sincere, not easy-going, not arrogant and vain

intorvert, sometimes arrogant, don't like asking question, oppsite role model, not so hardworking, no public things=: asks all questions, never angy to others, hardworking, extravert, public things.

as rolemodel: assertive, stubborn, calm, optimistic, open-minded
not as role model: not so self-confident, role model is more smart

I would like to tell you about my classmate Larry and compare him with his role model. His is a very interesting person. The person he admires is his IT teacher, who teached him during his 10 school year.

So, it is important to know that he is pretty opposite to his role model. For example, his teacher is an extravert who is always ready to ask any questions. But Larry says that sometimes he can be arrogant if people ask him questions, which are obvious for him. Also, Larry doesn't like any public speaks, but his teacher does. He can be really eloquent during his spiches. Larry says that he is not so hardworking as his teacher, who is very well educated and devoted to his work

In conclution I want to say that Larry is a very intellegent and smart person. He is always very polite and, to my mind, rather hardworking, as he hasn't skipped any English lessons. He is not so self-confident, as it is difficult for him tell possitive sides of his personality. Also he is comfortable person, who, i m sure, will be very succesfull

**Larry. The bird**
I would like to tell you about Larry’s favorite film. This is The birds, a classic thriller and horror movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock. This film was released in 1963 and is famous for its terrifying atmosphere.

The story takes place in a small town called Bodega Bay, where a series of mysterious bird attacks begins. The main characters are Melanie Daniels and Mitch Brenner. Melanie goes to Bodega Bay to surprise Mitch, but things quickly change when large groups of birds suddenly start attacking people for no reason. The film doesn't explain why the birds act like this, which makes it even more frightening.

Larry enjoys this film because of its intense clever storytelling. He admires Hitchcock’s ability to create fear without relying on modern special effects. There is even no music in the movie. It makes it even more scacy. Also, this film doesn't answer any questions in the end, it has open-ended conclusion and leaves room for interpretation. Larry also appreciates the strong performances of the actors, particularly Tippi Hedren, who plays Melanie.

Nowadays there are a lot of people working abroad. In this essay I am going to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of being so far away for getting salary and I will provide my personal opinion.
Obviously there are two main advantages. Firstly, if you work abroad, you can find lots of possibilities for your career. For example, you would probably have more well-payed job and better team you are working with, simply because you can able to chose from many employers. Secondly, being in another country can be very valuable experience for your culture and language knowladge. You may bump into a lot new things. For instance, my bother have been distance working for a German company for some time. And one day his boss suggested him to visit Germany for 2 moth to work (очно) with his colleagues. He told, that it was a great opportune to learn about local culture and simply to trip around the world.
On the other hand, moving diffuculties and language barier are the disadvantages. Well, of course moving so generally can be hard (заменить синонимом). You need to have a lot documents, each and everyone of them must be done for some time (заменить лучшей формулировкой, сохранить формлировку each and everyone или ей подобную). Sometimes creating a document can money not everyone can afford.  not to mention the fact that you can't move to some countries, that you probably would like to. For example, to be the resident of USA you must have a Green Card. There are some possiblities to get it, but the process is not ended by this point. You have to pay a lot of money to finally come to America and go though many interwiews. For example, the consular and green card fees are already over $600. Also, you level of local language can be a problem. If you are not conviniet in everyday cominication words, it can be difficult (заменить) to live somewhere. My brother found a lot new option in language while living in English-speaking country.
In conclusion advantages outway disadvantages. In my opinion .....d

**Working Abroad: Pros and Cons**

Nowadays, many people choose to work abroad. In this essay I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of being so far away for getting salary and I will provide my personal opinion.

There are two main advantages. Firstly, working abroad offers many career opportunities. For example, you can find better-paid jobs and work in more interesting teams because you can choose from many employers. Secondly, living in another country provides valuable cultural and language experience. You may find out new traditions and habits. For instance, my brother worked remotely for a German company and one day his boss invited him to spend two months working on-site with his colleagues in Germany. He said it was a great chance to learn about local culture and travel.

On the other hand, challenges like relocation and language barriers can be disadvantages. You need to prepare many documents and making of each and every one of them takes a lot of time. There are cases, when the cost of preparing these documents is unaffordable for some people. Additionally, not all countries are easy to move to. For example, you must have a Green Card to live in the USA. While there are ways to obtain one, the process doesn’t end there. You also have to pay significant fees and attend interviews. For instance, the consular and Green Card fees alone exceed more than $600. Language barier can also be a problem. If you are not confident in everyday communication, it may be challenging to adapt to new conditions.

In conclusion, although working abroad has its difficulties, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, gaining career opportunities and cultural experience makes it worth trying.

Your plans for next summer sound amazing! I really appreciate how much thought you have already done for your trip. I think getting tickets for a music festival is a fantastic idea, I love live music too! Maybe we could also visit some local sights or spend a day hiking in the countryside.

Now I am very interested, what kind of music festivals do you like? Let me know if you need help looking for tickets or planning anything else. I’m really looking forward to seeing you and having a fantastic time together.

Drop me a line when you can!
Love,
Artem
